# FUSE Level File System

Note: This was originally a coursework submission and some boilerplate code was given as well as a key-value database. Those were not my work and cannot be uploaded here.
This additionally means that some code initialising the 'filesystem' is missing.
Further it was a requirement for all operations to be in one file.
